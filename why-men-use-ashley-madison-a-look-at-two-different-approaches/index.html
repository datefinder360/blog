It is a dating website designed specifically for married people looking to have an affair. Despite the controversy, it has grown in popularity over the years, and many men have turned to the site for various reasons. Here, we take a look at two male Ashley Madison members and why they use the service.<br><br><strong>Approach One: Flirting and Getting to Know a Lady</strong><br><br>One of the male Ashley Madison members interviewed by INSIDER said that he uses the service because it "feels really nice flirting and getting to know a lady." He enjoys the thrill of meeting someone new and the feeling of being desired. He also said that he likes the idea of having a secret relationship and the feeling of being naughty.<br><br><strong>Approach Two: Filling a Void in a Marriage</strong><br><br>The other male Ashley Madison member interviewed by INSIDER said that he uses the service to fill a void in his marriage. He said that he loves the temptation and the feelings that he gets from the service that are missing in his marriage. He also said that he likes the idea of having a secret relationship and the feeling of being naughty.<br><br>The two male Ashley Madison members interviewed by INSIDER have two very different approaches to why they use the service. One uses it to flirt and get to know a lady, while the other uses it to fill a void in his marriage. Despite the controversy surrounding the website, it has grown in popularity over the years, and many men have turned to the service for various reasons.</p><footer><div class="post__tag-share"><div class="post__share"></div></div></footer></div></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">DateFinder360, 1991-2023</div></footer></div></div><script defer="defer" src="https://datefinder360.github.io/blog/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=27706a8fe221267c1834098c796f44c1"></script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
