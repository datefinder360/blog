While there are many factors that can contribute to a couple's decision to end their marriage, research has identified one key predictor of divorce: contempt.<br><br><strong>Contempt: The Number 1 Predictor of Divorce</strong><br><br>In 1994, renowned relationship expert John Gottman conducted a study that identified contempt as the number one predictor of divorce within the first six years of marriage. Gottman's research showed that couples who expressed contempt towards each other were more likely to divorce than couples who did not.<br><br>Contempt has been defined as "the expression of scorn or disdain for someone or something." It is a form of communication that is both hostile and disrespectful, and can take the form of criticism, name-calling, sarcasm, and other negative behaviors.<br><br><strong>Recent Research on Contempt and Divorce</strong><br><br>More recent research from 2019 suggests that harboring contempt is not only a predictor of divorce, but also a predictor of poor physical and mental health. The study found that couples who expressed contempt towards each other were more likely to experience depression, anxiety, and other physical illnesses.<br><br>The research also showed that couples who experienced contempt were more likely to engage in destructive behaviors, such as drinking and drug use. This can further contribute to a couple's decision to divorce, as it can create a cycle of negative behavior that is difficult to break.<br><br><strong>The Impact of Contempt on Relationships</strong><br><br>Contempt is a destructive force in relationships, as it can erode trust and respect. It can also create a hostile environment in which communication and compromise become difficult. Couples who are unable to effectively communicate and resolve conflicts are more likely to experience marital dissatisfaction and eventually divorce.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong><br><br>Contempt is the number one predictor of divorce within the first six years of marriage, according to research from 1994. Recent research from 2019 also suggests that harboring contempt is a predictor of an illness and poor well-being. It is important for couples to recognize the impact of contempt on their relationship and take steps to address it before it leads to divorce.</p><footer><div class="post__tag-share"><div class="post__share"></div></div></footer></div></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">DateFinder360, 1991-2023</div></footer></div></div><script defer="defer" src="https://datefinder360.github.io/blog/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=27706a8fe221267c1834098c796f44c1"></script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
