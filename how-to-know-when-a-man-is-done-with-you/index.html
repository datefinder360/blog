It can be even harder to accept that a relationship is over, falling apart and possibly beyond repair.

These include:<br><br>He Makes Little Effort to Communicate: If your man is no longer making an effort to communicate with you, this is a clear sign that he is done with the relationship. He may no longer be responding to your calls or texts, or he may be avoiding conversations about the relationship.<br><br>He Becomes Evasive: If your man is becoming evasive and avoiding anything to do with you, this is a sign that he is done with the relationship. He may be avoiding conversations about the relationship, or he may be avoiding spending time with you.<br><br>He Pushes You Away When You Want to Get Close: If your man is pushing you away when you want to get close, this is a sign that he is done with the relationship. He may be avoiding physical contact, or he may be avoiding spending time with you.<br><br>He Doesn't Show Up When He Promised: If your man is no longer showing up when he promised, this is a sign that he is done with the relationship.
