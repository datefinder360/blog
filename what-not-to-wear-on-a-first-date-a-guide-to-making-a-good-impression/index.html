You should also avoid wearing clothing that is too tight or too short.<br><br><strong>Clothing that is Too Casual</strong><br><br>On the other hand, you don’t want to wear something that is too casual. A first date is not the time to wear your favorite pair of sweatpants or a t-shirt. You should opt for something that is a bit more dressy, such as a nice dress or a pair of slacks and a blouse.<br><br><strong>Clothing that is Too Formal</strong><br><br>You also don’t want to wear something that is too formal. If you’re going to a nice restaurant, you don’t need to wear a tuxedo or a ball gown. A nice dress or a pair of slacks and a blouse is appropriate for most first dates.<br><br><strong>Clothing that is Too Trendy</strong><br><br>Finally, you don’t want to wear something that is too trendy. You don’t want to look like you’re trying too hard. Stick to classic pieces that will never go out of style.<br><br>When you’re getting ready for a first date, it’s important to make sure you’re wearing the right clothing.
