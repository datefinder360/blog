It is important to consider all of the factors before making a decision. In this article, we will discuss whether or not you should divorce over a sexless marriage.<br><br><strong>What is a Sexless Marriage?</strong><br><br>A sexless marriage is defined as a marriage in which the couple has not had sex for at least six months. This does not necessarily mean that the couple is not in love, but it does mean that they are not physically intimate. This can be a difficult situation for both partners, as physical intimacy is an important part of any relationship.<br><br><strong>What Causes a Sexless Marriage?</strong><br><br>There are many reasons why a marriage may become sexless. These can include physical or mental health issues, work-related stress, or a lack of communication. It is important to identify the cause of the problem in order to find a solution.<br><br><strong>Should You Divorce Over a Sexless Marriage?</strong><br><br>A sexless marriage does not always equal a loveless marriage. When it does, however, divorce may be the “best worst” option. It is important to remember that physical intimacy is a basic human need, and if it is not being met in the marriage, it may be time to consider other options.<br><br><strong>What Are the Alternatives?</strong><br><br>Before making a decision to divorce, it is important to consider other alternatives. Couples counseling can be a great way to identify the root cause of the problem and find a solution. Additionally, couples can try to reconnect by spending more quality time together and engaging in activities that they both enjoy.<br><br>When a marriage becomes sexless, it can be difficult to know what to do.
