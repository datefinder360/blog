It's a subject that has gained increased attention in recent years as more people are speaking out about their experiences. But just how common are sexless relationships?</p><p>Estimating the Prevalence of Sexless Relationships</p><p>There is no perfect definition for a sexless relationship. For some couples, it may mean not having sex at all, while for others, it may mean having sex infrequently. Despite this ambiguity, experts agree that sexless relationships are common.</p><p>Newsweek estimates that about 15 to 20 percent of couples are in a sexless relationship. This means that out of every five couples, one is likely to experience a lack of sexual intimacy. The prevalence of sexless relationships is even higher for those who have been together for a long time, with nearly half of couples who have been together for more than 10 years experiencing a decline in sexual activity.</p><p>Understanding the Causes of Sexless Relationships</p><p>There are a variety of factors that can contribute to a sexless relationship. One of the most common causes is a lack of communication between partners. When couples don't talk about their sexual needs and desires, they may become disconnected from each other and lose interest in sex.</p><p>Other factors that can lead to a sexless relationship include stress, health issues, and relationship problems. For example, if one partner is dealing with a chronic illness or experiencing depression, they may not be in the mood for sex. In addition, relationship problems such as infidelity or a lack of emotional intimacy can also contribute to a lack of sexual intimacy.</p><p>Impact of Sexless Relationships on Individuals and Couples</p><p>Living in a sexless relationship can be challenging for both individuals and couples. For many, sexual intimacy is an important part of feeling connected to their partner and feeling fulfilled in their relationship. When that intimacy is missing, it can lead to feelings of frustration, rejection, and resentment.</p><p>However, it's important to note that not all couples who are in a sexless relationship feel negatively about it. Some couples may find that they're perfectly content with a lack of sexual intimacy and may choose to focus on other aspects of their relationship instead.</p><p>Ways to Address a Sexless Relationship</p><p>If you're in a sexless relationship and it's causing distress, it's important to address the issue with your partner. This may involve having an open and honest conversation about your sexual needs and desires. It's important to approach the conversation in a non-judgmental way and be willing to listen to your partner's perspective.</p><p>In some cases, seeking the help of a therapist or counselor can also be beneficial. A professional can help couples to work through issues such as communication problems, health issues, or relationship problems that may be contributing to a lack of sexual intimacy.</p><p>While a sexless relationship can be challenging, it's important to remember that it's a common issue that many couples face. Understanding the causes of a sexless relationship and being willing to address the issue with your partner can help to improve your relationship and increase sexual intimacy. If you're struggling with a lack of sexual intimacy in your relationship, know that you're not alone and there are ways to work through the issue.</p><footer><div class="post__tag-share"><div class="post__share"></div></div></footer></div></div></article><div class="main__right"><div class="banner banner--after-post"><a href="https://siteoff.github.io/registration"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/singleconnect24/img/main/clickUSA1.jpg" alt="Dating USA"></a></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">DateFinder360, 1991-2023</div></footer></div></div><script defer="defer" src="https://datefinder360.github.io/blog/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=27706a8fe221267c1834098c796f44c1"></script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
