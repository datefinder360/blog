This behavior is usually seen early on in a relationship, when one partner is trying to hide their promiscuity. It is important to note that roaching is not necessarily a sign of cheating, but rather a sign of a lack of commitment.<br><br><strong>The Signs of Roaching</strong><br><br>There are several signs that can indicate roaching in a relationship. These include:<br><br>• Being secretive about their whereabouts or who they are with<br><br>• Not introducing you to their friends or family<br><br>• Not wanting to commit to plans or make long-term commitments<br><br>• Making excuses for why they can’t be with you<br><br>• Refusing to answer questions about their past relationships<br><br>• Being evasive when asked about their feelings for you<br><br><strong>The Dangers of Roaching</strong><br><br>Roaching can be dangerous for a relationship because it can lead to feelings of mistrust and insecurity. If one partner is not being honest about their behavior, it can lead to a lack of trust and a feeling of being taken advantage of. This can lead to a breakdown in communication and can ultimately lead to the end of the relationship.<br><br><strong>How to Deal with Roaching</strong><br><br>If you suspect that your partner is roaching, it is important to talk to them about it. Make sure to be open and honest about your feelings and concerns. If your partner is not willing to be honest with you, it may be time to consider ending the relationship.<br><br>Roaching is a term used to describe a behavior in which a partner hides the fact that they are still sleeping around with other people.
