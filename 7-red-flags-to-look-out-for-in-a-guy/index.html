Here are seven signs to look out for when dating a guy.<br><br>1. Narcissism<br><br>A guy who is overly focused on himself and his own needs can be a sign of narcissism. He may be unwilling to compromise or take responsibility for his actions, and he may be more concerned with his own image than your feelings.<br><br>2. Aggression<br><br>If a guy is overly aggressive or controlling, it can be a sign of potential abuse. He may try to control your behavior or manipulate you into doing things his way.<br><br>3. Victimization<br><br>If a guy is constantly playing the victim, it can be a sign of emotional immaturity. He may be unwilling to take responsibility for his own actions and may blame others for his problems.<br><br>4. Abusive Behavior<br><br>If a guy is exhibiting signs of abusive behavior, such as name-calling, threats, or physical violence, it’s a major red flag. This type of behavior should never be tolerated and should be addressed immediately.<br><br>5. Jealousy<br><br>If a guy is overly jealous or possessive, it can be a sign of insecurity. He may be trying to control you or prevent you from having relationships with other people.<br><br>6. Lack of Respect<br><br>If a guy doesn’t respect your boundaries or opinions, it can be a sign of disrespect. He may be unwilling to compromise or listen to your point of view.<br><br>7. Unreliability<br><br>If a guy is unreliable or frequently cancels plans, it can be a sign of a lack of commitment. He may not be taking the relationship seriously or may not be interested in a long-term relationship.<br><br>Becoming aware of these red flags can help you avoid getting involved in a toxic relationship. If you notice any of these signs in a guy, it’s important to address them and take action to protect yourself.<br><br>Title: 7 Red Flags to Look Out for in a Guy</p><footer><div class="post__tag-share"><div class="post__share"></div></div></footer></div></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">DateFinder360, 1991-2023</div></footer></div></div><script defer="defer" src="https://datefinder360.github.io/blog/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=27706a8fe221267c1834098c796f44c1"></script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
