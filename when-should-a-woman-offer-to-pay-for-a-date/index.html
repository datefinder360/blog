Admittedly, after nearly 27 years of marriage, we have been out of the dating game for quite some time. Nonetheless, here's our advice to her on the first-date funding dilemma. <br><br><strong>Most Etiquette Experts Agree:</strong><br><br>• If you're asked out, your date should pay. Most etiquette experts suggest this as a good rule of thumb for a first date. <br><br>• If you ask someone out, you should offer to pay. It's a sign of respect and consideration for your date. <br><br>• If you're in a relationship, it's up to you and your partner to decide who pays. Some couples prefer to split the bill, while others prefer to alternate who pays. <br><br>• If you're on a group date, the person who asked everyone out should pay. <br><br>• If you're in a same-sex relationship, it's up to you and your partner to decide who pays. <br><br>• If you're on a double date, the couples should split the bill. <br><br><strong>When to Offer to Pay:</strong><br><br>• If your date insists on paying, you can offer to pay for the tip or the next round of drinks. <br><br>• If you feel like your date is trying to show off or take advantage of you, you can offer to pay your share. <br><br>• If you're in a long-term relationship, you can offer to pay for special occasions or to show your appreciation. <br><br>• If you're in a committed relationship, you can offer to pay for date nights or special outings. <br><br>• If you're in a serious relationship, you can offer to pay for vacations or other special occasions. <br><br>• If you want to show your date that you care, you can offer to pay for something small, like dessert or a round of drinks. <br><br>Ultimately, it's up to you and your date to decide who pays for the date. If you're asked out, your date should pay. If you ask someone out, you should offer to pay. If you're in a relationship, it's up to you and your partner to decide who pays. And if you want to show your date that you care, you can offer to pay for something small. <br><br>No matter what, it's important to be respectful and considerate of your date's feelings. And remember, it's the thought that counts!</p><footer><div class="post__tag-share"><div class="post__share"></div></div></footer></div></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">DateFinder360, 1991-2023</div></footer></div></div><script defer="defer" src="https://datefinder360.github.io/blog/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=27706a8fe221267c1834098c796f44c1"></script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
