The signs can be subtle, and sometimes it's hard to tell if your partner is just having a bad day or if they truly don't love you. Here are some signs that can help you determine if your partner doesn't love you.<br><br>They Don't Ask About You or Your Life<br>If your partner doesn't ask about your day, your job, or your life in general, it could be a sign that they don't care about you. A partner who loves you will be interested in your life and will want to know what's going on with you.<br><br>They Avoid Spending Time With You<br>If your partner is always busy and never has time for you, it could be a sign that they don't love you. A partner who loves you will make time for you and will want to spend time with you.<br><br>They Have No Interest in Meeting or Hanging Out With Your Family or Friends<br>If your partner isn't interested in meeting your family or friends, it could be a sign that they don't love you. A partner who loves you will want to get to know the people who are important to you.<br><br>They Don't Want to Be Intimate With You<br>If your partner isn't interested in being intimate with you, it could be a sign that they don't love you. A partner who loves you will want to be close to you and will be interested in being intimate with you.<br><br>They ONLY Want to Be Intimate With You<br>If your partner only wants to be intimate with you and never wants to do anything else, it could be a sign that they don't love you. A partner who loves you will want to do more than just be intimate with you.<br><br>They Disappear or Ghost You for Periods of Time<br>If your partner disappears or ghosts you for periods of time, it could be a sign that they don't love you. A partner who loves you will make time for you and will be there for you when you need them.<br><br>These are just a few signs that can help you determine if your partner doesn't love you. If you're noticing any of these signs, it's important to talk to your partner and figure out what's going on. It's never easy to realize that your partner doesn't love you, but it's important to be honest with yourself and your partner so that you can both move forward.</p><footer><div class="post__tag-share"><div class="post__share"></div></div></footer></div></div></article><div class="main__right"><div class="banner banner--after-post"><a href="https://siteoff.github.io/registration"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/singleconnect24/img/main/clickUSA2.jpg" alt="Dating USA"></a></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">DateFinder360, 1991-2023</div></footer></div></div><script defer="defer" src="https://datefinder360.github.io/blog/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=27706a8fe221267c1834098c796f44c1"></script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
