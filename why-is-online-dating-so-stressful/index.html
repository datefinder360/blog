It’s reported that dating app users face three times the amount of stress compared to non-users. With online dating, you miss that personal connection during a first impression and many view dating apps as being based on physical attraction. This can lead to comparing yourself to others and increased self judgement.<br><br><strong>Common Causes of Online Dating Stress</strong><br><br>There are a number of common causes of online dating stress, including:<br><br>• Fear of Rejection: Rejection is a common fear for many people, and this fear can be magnified when it comes to online dating. It can be difficult to gauge someone’s interest and it’s easy to take it personally if you don’t get a response.<br><br>• Unrealistic Expectations: Many people have unrealistic expectations when it comes to online dating. It’s easy to get caught up in the idea of finding the perfect person, and this can lead to disappointment and frustration.<br><br>• Pressure to Perform: Online dating can feel like a performance, and this can lead to feelings of pressure and stress.<br><br>• Safety Concerns: It’s important to be aware of safety concerns when it comes to online dating. Meeting someone in person can be intimidating, and it’s important to be aware of potential risks.<br><br><strong>How to Manage Online Dating Stress</strong><br><br>Managing online dating stress can be difficult, but there are a few things you can do to make it easier:<br><br>• Set Realistic Expectations: It’s important to set realistic expectations when it comes to online dating. Don’t expect to find the perfect person right away, and be open to different types of people.<br><br>• Take Breaks: It’s important to take breaks from online dating. Take a few days off to relax and recharge, and don’t be afraid to take a break if you’re feeling overwhelmed.<br><br>• Be Open and Honest: Be open and honest with potential dates. Don’t try to be someone you’re not, and be honest about your expectations and intentions.<br><br>• Trust Your Instincts: It’s important to trust your instincts when it comes to online dating. If something doesn’t feel right, don’t be afraid to walk away.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong><br><br>Online dating can be a great way to meet new people, but it can also be a source of stress and anxiety. It’s important to be aware of the common causes of online dating stress and to take steps to manage it.
