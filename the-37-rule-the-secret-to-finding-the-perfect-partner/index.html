But, there is a secret formula that could help you find the right person for you: the 37% rule.<br><br><strong>What is the 37% Rule?</strong><br><br>The 37% rule is a mathematical formula that suggests that the best way to find the perfect partner is to date and reject the first 37% of your total group of lifetime suitors. This rule was first proposed by Harvard mathematician Peter Backus in a 2016 study.<br><br><strong>How Does the 37% Rule Work?</strong><br><br>The 37% rule is based on the mathematical concept of the "optimal stopping theory". This theory states that if you have a finite set of options, the best way to find the best one is to reject the first 37% of the options and then choose the first option that is better than the ones you have already rejected.<br><br>In the case of finding a partner, this means that you should date and reject the first 37% of your total group of lifetime suitors and then choose the first person that is better than the ones you have already rejected.<br><br><strong>Benefits of the 37% Rule</strong><br><br>The 37% rule has several benefits. First, it helps you find the best possible partner by eliminating the people who are not right for you. Second, it saves you time and energy by allowing you to quickly identify the people who are not right for you. Third, it gives you a greater chance of finding the perfect partner by allowing you to focus on the people who are more likely to be the right fit for you.<br><br>The 37% rule is a mathematical formula that suggests that the best way to find the perfect partner is to date and reject the first 37% of your total group of lifetime suitors.
