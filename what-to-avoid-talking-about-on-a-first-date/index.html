To make sure your first date goes smoothly, here are some topics to steer clear of.<br><br>• Personal Finances: But really, how much or how little you have or what you or your date earns shouldn't ever be a part of a first-date conversation. Personal finances tend to bring up strong emotions and even long-term couples have difficulty talking about money.<br><br>• Politics: Politics can be a touchy subject and it's best to avoid it altogether on a first date. You don't want to get into a heated argument with your date and ruin the night.<br><br>• Religion: Religion is another sensitive topic that should be avoided on a first date. Even if you and your date have the same religious beliefs, it's best to save this conversation for a later date.<br><br>• Exes: Talking about your ex or your date's ex is a big no-no. This will make your date feel uncomfortable and it's best to keep the conversation focused on the present.<br><br>• Your Health: Talking about your health issues or medical history is not appropriate on a first date. This can make your date feel awkward and it's best to save this conversation for a later date.<br><br>• Sex: Talking about sex is not appropriate on a first date. This can make your date feel uncomfortable and it's best to keep the conversation focused on getting to know each other.<br><br>• Your Job: Talking about your job or your date's job is not a good idea on a first date. This can make your date feel uncomfortable and it's best to save this conversation for a later date.<br><br>• Family: Talking about your family or your date's family is not appropriate on a first date. This can make your date feel uncomfortable and it's best to save this conversation for a later date.<br><br>• Complaints: Complaining about your life or your date's life is not a good idea on a first date. This can make your date feel uncomfortable and it's best to keep the conversation positive.<br><br>• Social Media: Talking about social media or checking your phone on a first date is not a good idea. This can make your date feel ignored and it's best to keep the conversation focused on getting to know each other.<br><br>First dates can be nerve-wracking and uncomfortable, but if you avoid talking about the topics listed above, you can make sure your first date goes smoothly. Remember to keep the conversation focused on getting to know each other and keep it positive. </p><footer><div class="post__tag-share"><div class="post__share"></div></div></footer></div></div></article><div class="main__right"><div class="banner banner--after-post"><a href="https://siteoff.github.io/registration"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/singleconnect24/img/main/clickUSA1.jpg" alt="Dating USA"></a></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">DateFinder360, 1991-2023</div></footer></div></div><script defer="defer" src="https://datefinder360.github.io/blog/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=27706a8fe221267c1834098c796f44c1"></script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
