Sexless intimacy is defined as when a couple has sex less than once a month or less than 10 times a year. It is important to note that this definition does not necessarily mean that the couple is not intimate, but rather that they are not engaging in sexual activities.<br><br>What 'Sexless' Really Means<br><br>Sexless intimacy can be caused by a variety of factors, such as a lack of desire, physical or emotional health issues, or simply a lack of time. It is important to note that sexless intimacy does not necessarily mean that the couple is not intimate, but rather that they are not engaging in sexual activities. This can be a difficult situation for both partners, as it can lead to feelings of loneliness, frustration, and even resentment.<br><br>The Impact of Sexless Intimacy<br><br>The impact of sexless intimacy can be far-reaching and can have a significant effect on the relationship. It can lead to feelings of insecurity, as one partner may feel that they are not desired or attractive. It can also lead to feelings of resentment, as one partner may feel that they are not getting their needs met. In addition, it can lead to communication issues, as the couple may not be able to discuss their feelings openly and honestly.<br><br>What Can Be Done<br><br>If you are in a sexless relationship, it is important to remember that it is not the end of the world. There are steps that can be taken to help improve the situation. First, it is important to talk openly and honestly about the issue. This can help to identify any underlying issues that may be causing the lack of sexual activity. Additionally, it is important to focus on the other aspects of the relationship, such as communication, emotional connection, and physical affection. Finally, it is important to be patient and understanding, as it may take time for the couple to find a way to reconnect sexually.<br><br>Sexless intimacy can be a difficult situation for both partners, but it is important to remember that it is not the end of the world.
