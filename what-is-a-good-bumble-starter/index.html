Everyone loves to be complimented, so make sure your compliment is genuine and specific. For example, you could say, “I love your taste in music! What’s your favorite artist?”<br><br>Finally, mentioning something in their profile is a great way to show that you’ve taken the time to read their profile and that you’re interested in getting to know them better. For example, if they mention that they love to travel, you could say, “I noticed you love to travel. Where’s the most interesting place you’ve been?”<br><br>A good Bumble starter is an important part of making a good first impression on the dating app. The best way to start a conversation is to ask an open-ended question, offer a compliment, or mention something in their profile.
