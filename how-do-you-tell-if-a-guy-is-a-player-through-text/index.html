If you’re communicating with someone via text, it can be even harder to tell if they’re a player. To help you out, here’s a guide on how to tell if a guy is a player through text.<br><br><strong>He Only Texts You Late at Night</strong><br><br>One of the most obvious signs that a guy is a player is if he only texts you late at night. If he’s only texting you after 11:00 p.m., and claims he misses you, it’s not your smile he’s missing. He’s just fantasizing about how long it will take to get you over before he has to fish for backups.<br><br><strong>He’s Always Flirting</strong><br><br>Another sign that a guy is a player is if he’s always flirting with you via text. If he’s constantly sending you suggestive messages, or if he’s always trying to make plans to hang out, it’s likely that he’s just looking for a hookup.<br><br><strong>He’s Vague About His Plans</strong><br><br>If a guy is always vague about his plans and doesn’t give you a straight answer when you ask him what he’s doing, it’s likely that he’s a player. Players don’t want to be tied down, so they’ll often be vague about their plans in order to keep their options open.<br><br><strong>He Doesn’t Ask About Your Life</strong><br><br>If a guy never asks you about your life or your interests, it’s a sign that he’s not really interested in getting to know you. A player will often just want to talk about himself and won’t be interested in getting to know you on a deeper level.<br><br>If you’re trying to figure out if a guy is a player through text, there are a few signs to look out for. If he only texts you late at night, is always flirting, is vague about his plans, and doesn’t ask about your life, it’s likely that he’s a player. By being aware of these signs, you can protect yourself from getting played.<br><br></p><footer><div class="post__tag-share"><div class="post__share"></div></div></footer></div></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">DateFinder360, 1991-2023</div></footer></div></div><script defer="defer" src="https://datefinder360.github.io/blog/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=27706a8fe221267c1834098c796f44c1"></script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
