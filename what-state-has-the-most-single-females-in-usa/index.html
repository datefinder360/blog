Louisiana has the highest share of single females in the country, with 55.7% of its female population living alone. This is followed by Rhode Island (55.7%), New York (55.4%), and Mississippi (54.9%).</p><blockquote><p><strong>Rank State Share Single</strong><br>1 Louisiana 55.7%<br>2 Rhode Island 55.7%<br>3 New York 55.4%<br>4 Mississippi 54.9%<br><br>These four states are the top four in terms of the highest share of single females in the United States.

It is important to note that the share of single females in the United States has been steadily increasing since the 1990s.<br><br>The reasons for the high share of single females in Louisiana and other states vary. In Louisiana, for example, the high share of single females is likely due to the state’s large African American population, which is more likely to be single than other racial and ethnic groups. Other factors, such as the state’s poverty rate and the prevalence of single-parent households, may also be contributing to the high share of single females in Louisiana.<br><br>In conclusion, Louisiana has the highest share of single females in the United States, with 55.7% of its female population living alone. This is followed by Rhode Island (55.7%), New York (55.4%), and Mississippi (54.9%). The remaining states in the top 17 have a share of single females that is higher than the national average of 52.2%.
