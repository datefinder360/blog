However, some couples may find themselves in a relationship where sexual intimacy has become scarce or non-existent. This leads to the question: do sexless relationships exist?</p><p>The short answer is yes. According to a study, around 15% of married couples are considered sexless. This means that they haven't engaged in sexual activities with each other for six months to a year. Additionally, people can also experience sexless relationships outside of marriage. In this article, we will explore the reasons why sexless relationships exist and their potential impact on couples.</p><p>What Causes Sexless Relationships?</p><p>There is no single answer to what causes sexless relationships. Several factors can contribute to a lack of sexual intimacy in a relationship. Here are some of the most common reasons:</p><ol><li><p>Physical or Medical Issues: Chronic illness, disability, and hormonal imbalances can negatively affect a person's libido, leading to a decline in sexual activity.</p></li><li><p>Psychological Factors: Stress, anxiety, depression, and trauma can all impact a person's desire for sexual activity.</p></li><li><p>Communication Breakdown: Couples who struggle to communicate with each other about their needs and desires may find it difficult to engage in sexual activity.</p></li><li><p>Infidelity or Resentment: Betrayal and resentment can damage a couple's emotional connection, leading to a lack of intimacy in the relationship.</p></li></ol><p>The Impact of Sexless Relationships</p><p>Sexless relationships can have a significant impact on a couple's emotional and physical wellbeing. Here are some of the potential consequences:</p><ol><li><p>Emotional Distance: The lack of sexual intimacy can lead to emotional distance and a loss of intimacy in the relationship.</p></li><li><p>Resentment and Frustration: One partner may feel neglected or frustrated due to the lack of sexual activity, which can lead to resentment and conflicts in the relationship.</p></li><li><p>Infidelity: If a person's sexual needs are not met in their current relationship, they may look for sexual fulfillment outside the relationship, leading to infidelity.</p></li><li><p>Breakup or Divorce: Sexless relationships can lead to breakups or divorces if the couple is unable to resolve their differences and rekindle their sexual intimacy.</p></li></ol><p>Final Thoughts</p><p>Sexless relationships can be challenging and frustrating for couples. However, it is essential to remember that a lack of sexual intimacy does not mean the end of the relationship. It is essential to identify the underlying causes and work together to find solutions that work for both partners.</p><p>While sexless relationships do exist, they are not necessarily doomed to fail. With patience, open communication, and professional help if needed, couples can work towards rekindling their sexual intimacy and emotional connection.</p><footer><div class="post__tag-share"><div class="post__share"></div></div></footer></div></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">DateFinder360, 1991-2023</div></footer></div></div><script defer="defer" src="https://datefinder360.github.io/blog/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=27706a8fe221267c1834098c796f44c1"></script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
