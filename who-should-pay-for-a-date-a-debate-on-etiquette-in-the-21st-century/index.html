A Debate on Etiquette in the 21st Century&quot;</h1></header></div><div class="main__right"><div class="post__entry"><p>In the 21st century, the age-old question of who should pay for a date has become more complicated than ever. Some etiquette experts still insist that the man should always cover the bill, while others argue that it's 2019 and women are perfectly capable of paying for themselves. The only certain thing is that going Dutch is always an option.<br><br><strong>Etiquette Experts</strong><br><br>According to traditional etiquette, the man should always pay for a date. This is because the man is seen as the one who is doing the asking, and it is his responsibility to cover the costs. This is a rule that has been around for centuries, and it is still upheld by many etiquette experts today.<br><br><strong>Women's Rights</strong><br><br>However, there are those who argue that in 2019, women are perfectly capable of paying for themselves. They point out that women have the same rights as men, and that they should not be expected to rely on men to pay for them. This is especially true in the case of a first date, where the woman may not even know the man very well.<br><br><strong>Going Dutch</strong><br><br>For some, the only option is to go Dutch on a date. This means that both parties pay for their own share of the bill, which is seen as a fair and equitable solution. Going Dutch is especially popular among young people, who may not have the same financial resources as their older counterparts.<br><br>Ultimately, who should pay for a date is a matter of personal preference. Some people still adhere to traditional etiquette, while others believe that women should be able to pay for themselves. And for those who don't want to choose, going Dutch is always an option.</p><footer><div class="post__tag-share"><div class="post__share"></div></div></footer></div></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">DateFinder360, 1991-2023</div></footer></div></div><script defer="defer" src="https://datefinder360.github.io/blog/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=27706a8fe221267c1834098c796f44c1"></script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
