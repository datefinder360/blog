But with the influx of new users, it’s important to know what not to do on Hinge. Whether you’re new to the app or an experienced user, it’s essential to know the dos and don’ts of Hinge to make sure you’re making the best of your online dating experience.<br><br>Below, you’ll find five things not to do when it comes to your photos and five things to avoid when writing your prompts.<br><br><strong>Ditch The Guessing Game</strong><br><br>When it comes to your photos, it’s important to make sure that they accurately reflect who you are. According to Hinge, you want to pick photos that make it easy to see what you look like. This means avoiding photos that are too dark, blurry, or heavily edited. Don’t make your potential matches guess who you are – pick photos that are clear and easy to understand.<br><br><strong>No Gym Photos Allowed</strong><br><br>While you may be proud of your hard work at the gym, it’s important to remember that Hinge isn’t the place to show off your fitness routine. Instead, pick photos that show off your personality and interests. Show your potential matches what you like to do in your free time, or how you like to spend time with your friends.<br><br><strong>No Smokers Allowed</strong><br><br>Hinge is a dating app, not a smoking app. If you’re a smoker, it’s important to remember that your potential matches may not be. To avoid any potential awkwardness, make sure to avoid any photos that show you smoking.<br><br><strong>Don’t Be A Class Clown</strong><br><br>When it comes to your prompts, it’s important to remember that you’re trying to make a good impression. While it’s important to be yourself, it’s also important to avoid being too silly or over the top. Keep your prompts light and positive, and make sure to avoid any jokes that could be seen as offensive.<br><br><strong>Be Mindful Of Your Grammar</strong><br><br>When it comes to your prompts, it’s important to make sure that your grammar is on point. Poor grammar can be seen as a sign of laziness, so make sure to double check your prompts before you hit send.<br><br>By following these tips, you can make sure that you’re making the best of your Hinge experience. Remember, Hinge is a great way to meet new people, but it’s important to be mindful of what you’re posting and how you’re presenting yourself. If you’re looking for love, make sure to follow these tips and avoid any potential pitfalls.</p><footer><div class="post__tag-share"><div class="post__share"></div></div></footer></div></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">DateFinder360, 1991-2023</div></footer></div></div><script defer="defer" src="https://datefinder360.github.io/blog/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=27706a8fe221267c1834098c796f44c1"></script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
