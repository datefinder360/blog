This is a question that many people struggle with, as there is no one-size-fits-all answer. To help provide some insight, weâ€™ve gathered some data on the average number of dates people wait before having sex.<br><br>On Average, Men Reported Waiting About Five Dates, Women Closer to Nine<br>A study conducted by researchers at the University of South Florida found that, on average, men reported waiting about five dates, and women reported a preference of waiting closer to nine dates. Overall the average was about eight dates.<br><br>The study also found that men and women who waited longer to have sex reported higher levels of relationship satisfaction and better communication. This suggests that taking the time to get to know each other before having sex can be beneficial for a relationship.<br><br><strong>The Impact of Culture and Religion</strong><br>In addition to individual preferences, culture and religion can also have an impact on how long people wait to have sex. For example, some cultures and religions may have strict rules about when it is appropriate to have sex. It is important to consider these factors when making decisions about when to have sex.<br><br><strong>The Impact of Age</strong><br>Age can also play a role in how long people wait to have sex. Generally, younger people tend to wait less time before having sex than older people. This is likely due to the fact that younger people may be less experienced in relationships and may not have as much knowledge about the potential risks of having sex.<br><br>When it comes to deciding how many dates to wait before having sex, it is important to consider your individual preferences, cultural and religious beliefs, and age. On average, people reported waiting about eight dates before having sex, but this number can vary depending on the individual. Ultimately, it is important to make sure that you are comfortable with your decision and that you are taking the necessary precautions to protect yourself.</p><footer><div class="post__tag-share"><div class="post__share"></div></div></footer></div></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">DateFinder360, 1991-2023</div></footer></div></div><script defer="defer" src="https://datefinder360.github.io/blog/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=27706a8fe221267c1834098c796f44c1"></script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
