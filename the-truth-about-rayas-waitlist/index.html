However, the app's strict admission policies mean that many people find themselves on a waitlist before they can access the platform. In this article, we'll answer the question of whether Raya waitlists everyone and share tips on how to get off the waitlist.</p><p>The Waitlist on Raya</p><p>Raya has about 100,000 people on its waitlist, which means that not everyone who applies will be admitted right away. The app's admission process is notoriously strict, and the waitlist is an essential part of that process.</p><p>According to Elite Dating Managers, men may be more likely to be accepted than women. However, this may be because there are more men than women on the app, rather than any gender bias in the admission process.</p><p>How to Get Off Raya's Waitlist</p><p>If you're on Raya's waitlist, there are a few things you can do to increase your chances of being admitted to the app. The first step is to make sure that your application is complete and that you've included all the necessary information. Raya looks for people who have a strong social media presence and a unique, creative profile. Make sure to highlight your best qualities and showcase what makes you stand out.</p><p>It's also important to be patient. Some people can spend weeks or months on the waitlist before being admitted to Raya, so don't worry if you don't hear back right away. You can also try reaching out to people who are already on the app and asking if they can refer you. Raya values referrals from current users, so having someone who can vouch for you can increase your chances of being accepted.</p><p>Another option is to pay for a membership to a service that helps people get accepted to Raya. These services, such as Raya Concierge or Raya Nomad, can help you navigate the admission process and increase your chances of being accepted.</p><p><span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">Not everyone who applies to Raya will be admitted right away.
