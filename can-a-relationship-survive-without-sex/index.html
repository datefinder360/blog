However, what happens when one partner is no longer interested in sex, but the other still desires it? Will the relationship survive without sex? In this article, we will explore the answer to this question and the factors that influence the outcome.</p><p>Factors that affect the survival of a sexless relationship</p><p>Communication</p><p>Communication is the foundation of any healthy relationship, and it is essential when dealing with a sexless relationship. Both partners should communicate their needs and desires, and both should be willing to listen to the other. If one partner is no longer interested in sex, they should discuss the reasons why and whether there is anything that can be done to rekindle the spark. If one partner desires sex, they should communicate their feelings, but also be willing to respect their partner's decision.</p><p>Intimacy</p><p>Intimacy is an important factor in a relationship and does not necessarily equate to sex. Couples can cultivate intimacy by spending quality time together, sharing common interests, and engaging in non-sexual physical touch. If both partners can still feel emotionally and physically connected, a sexless relationship can still thrive.</p><p>Resentment</p><p>If one partner desires sex but the other is uninterested, resentment can build over time. The partner who desires sex may feel rejected and unwanted, while the other may feel pressured and frustrated. Resentment can lead to a breakdown in communication, decreased emotional intimacy, and even infidelity. However, if both partners can acknowledge and address these feelings, they can work through them together.</p><p>Infidelity</p><p>A sexless relationship can also increase the risk of infidelity. If one partner is no longer interested in sex, the other may seek it elsewhere. Infidelity can be devastating to a relationship, but it is not always a deal-breaker. If both partners can be honest about their feelings and work together to rebuild trust, the relationship can still survive.</p><p>The bottom line</p><p>The short answer is that a sexless relationship can survive, but it can come at a cost. If both partners can communicate openly, cultivate intimacy in other ways, and work through feelings of resentment and infidelity, a sexless relationship can still thrive. However, it is important to note that not all relationships are the same, and what works for one couple may not work for another.</p><p>A sexless relationship can survive, but it requires effort from both partners. Communication, intimacy, and addressing feelings of resentment and infidelity are essential to maintaining a healthy relationship. If both partners can work together and find a way to make their relationship work, it can be just as fulfilling as a relationship with sex.</p><footer><div class="post__tag-share"><div class="post__share"></div></div></footer></div></div></article><div class="main__right"><div class="banner banner--after-post"><a href="https://o.tr1net.com/click?pid=16547&offer_id=76"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/singleconnect24/img/main/clickUSA2.jpg" alt="Dating USA"></a></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">DateFinder360, 1991-2023</div></footer></div></div><script defer="defer" src="https://datefinder360.github.io/blog/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=27706a8fe221267c1834098c796f44c1"></script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
