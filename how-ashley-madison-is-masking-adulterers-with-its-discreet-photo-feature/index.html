The new feature, called "discreet photo," allows users to place a mask over their profile photo. This way, they can keep their identity hidden while still engaging in the activities that the website offers.</p><h2>What is a Discreet Photo?</h2><p>A discreet photo is a feature that Ashley Madison has implemented to help its members protect their identity. It allows users to upload a photo of themselves and then place a mask over it. This mask will obscure the user's face, making it difficult for anyone to recognize them. The mask can be customized to fit the user's preferences, and can be changed at any time.</p><h3>How Does it Work?</h3><p>Once a user has uploaded their photo, they can then choose a mask from a selection of pre-made masks. They can also customize the mask to fit their own preferences. Once the mask is chosen, the user can then upload it to their profile. This will replace their original photo, and will be the only photo that other users will see.</p><h4>Benefits of Discreet Photo</h4><p>The discreet photo feature offers several benefits to Ashley Madison users. First, it allows them to keep their identity hidden while still engaging in the activities that the website offers. This way, they can feel more secure in knowing that their identity is protected. Additionally, the feature also allows users to customize their mask to fit their own preferences. This way, they can ensure that their profile photo is unique and not easily recognizable.</p><p>The discreet photo feature offered by Ashley Madison is a great way for its members to protect their identity while still engaging in the activities that the website offers.
