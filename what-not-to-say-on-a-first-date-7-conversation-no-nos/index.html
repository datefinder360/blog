The key is to be yourself and to keep the conversation light and positive. To help you out, we've rounded up seven things to avoid bringing up during your conversation to make sure it all goes smoothly.<br><br><strong>Too Much Talk About Your Ex</strong><br>No matter how great your ex was, it's best to keep the conversation focused on the present. Talking about your ex can make your date feel uncomfortable and can give the impression that you're still hung up on them.<br><br><strong>Any Weirdly Personal Questions</strong><br>Asking too many personal questions on a first date can be a huge turn-off. Questions about someone's job, salary, family, or past relationships can be intrusive and make your date feel like they're being interrogated.<br><br><strong>Sex Talk and Only Sex Talk</strong><br>It's natural to be attracted to someone you're on a date with, but talking about sex is not appropriate for a first date. Keep the conversation light and focus on getting to know each other.<br><br><strong>Love Bombing</strong><br>Love bombing is when someone showers their date with excessive compliments and declarations of love. This can be overwhelming and can make your date feel uncomfortable.<br><br><strong>Food Shaming</strong><br>Food shaming is when someone makes negative comments about what their date is eating. This is a huge no-no and can make your date feel embarrassed and self-conscious.<br><br><strong>Comments About Someone's Age</strong><br>Age is just a number, and it's not appropriate to make comments about someone's age on a first date. Doing so can make your date feel uncomfortable and can be seen as ageist.<br><br><strong>Rageful Diatribes</strong><br>It's important to be open and honest on a first date, but it's best to avoid getting into a heated argument or a rageful diatribe. Doing so can make your date feel uncomfortable and can ruin the mood.<br><br><strong>Judging Their Dating History</strong><br>It's natural to be curious about someone's dating history, but it's best to avoid asking too many questions or making judgments about it. Doing so can make your date feel judged and can be seen as intrusive.<br><br>When it comes to first dates, it's important to be yourself and to keep the conversation light and positive. Avoiding the topics mentioned above can help ensure that your date goes smoothly and that you make a good impression.</p><footer><div class="post__tag-share"><div class="post__share"></div></div></footer></div></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">DateFinder360, 1991-2023</div></footer></div></div><script defer="defer" src="https://datefinder360.github.io/blog/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=27706a8fe221267c1834098c796f44c1"></script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
