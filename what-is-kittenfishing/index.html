It is a form of catfishing, which is when someone pretends to be someone else online in order to gain attention or affection. Kittenfishing is slightly different, as it involves tweaking small details about your appearance or your life to make you appear 'better' on dating apps, as opposed to claiming to be a different person entirely.<br><br><strong>What Does Kittenfishing Look Like?</strong><br><br>Kittenfishing typically involves exaggerating or lying about certain aspects of yourself, such as your age, height, weight, job, or interests. It can also involve using outdated or heavily filtered photos, or even creating a completely false profile. People who kittenfish are often trying to appear more attractive or successful than they actually are, in order to gain attention or affection from potential partners.<br><br><strong>Why Do People Kittenfish?</strong><br><br>People often kittenfish because they feel insecure about their appearance or lifestyle. They may feel like they don't measure up to the people they see on dating apps, so they try to make themselves appear more attractive or successful. Unfortunately, this can lead to disappointment and frustration when the truth is revealed.<br><br><strong>How Can You Avoid Kittenfishing?</strong><br><br>The best way to avoid kittenfishing is to be honest about who you are. Don't try to make yourself appear more attractive or successful than you actually are. Instead, focus on highlighting your positive qualities and interests, and be open and honest about who you are. This will help you attract people who are genuinely interested in you, and it will also help you avoid any potential disappointment or frustration down the line.<br><br>Kittenfishing is a form of catfishing that involves exaggerating or lying about certain aspects of yourself in order to appear more attractive or successful on dating apps.
