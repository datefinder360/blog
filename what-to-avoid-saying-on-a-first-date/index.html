That's why we've rounded up seven things to avoid bringing up during your conversation to make sure it all goes smoothly.</p><h2>What to Avoid Saying on a First Date?</h2><p><strong>Too Much Talk About Your Ex</strong><br><br>Talking about your ex on a first date is a definite no-no. It can make your date feel like you're still hung up on your past relationship and not ready to move on. It can also make them feel like they're being compared to your ex, which is never a good feeling. So, try to keep the conversation focused on the present and avoid bringing up your ex.<br><br><strong>Any Weirdly Personal Questions</strong><br><br>When it comes to first dates, it's best to keep the conversation light and fun. Asking overly personal questions can make your date feel like they're being interrogated. It can also make them feel like you're trying to dig for information that you don't really need to know. So, stick to topics that are interesting and appropriate for a first date.<br><br><strong>Sex Talk and Only Sex Talk</strong><br><br>Talking about sex on a first date can be a tricky subject. On the one hand, it can be a fun and flirty way to get to know each other. On the other hand, it can make your date feel like you're only interested in one thing. So, if you do decide to bring up the topic of sex, make sure to keep it light and don't make it the only thing you talk about.<br><br><strong>Love Bombing</strong><br><br>Love bombing is when someone showers you with compliments and declarations of love in an attempt to make you feel special. While it may seem like a nice gesture, it can actually be quite off-putting. It can make your date feel like you're trying too hard or that you're not being genuine. So, try to keep the compliments light and avoid making any grand declarations of love.<br><br><strong>Food Shaming</strong><br><br>Food shaming is when someone makes comments about what someone else is eating. It can be a subtle comment or an outright criticism. Either way, it's not a good look. It can make your date feel uncomfortable and judged. So, try to keep the conversation focused on other topics and avoid making any comments about their food choices.<br><br><strong>Comments About Someone's Age</strong><br><br>Making comments about someone's age is a definite no-no. It can make your date feel like you're trying to put them down or make them feel self-conscious. So, try to keep the conversation focused on other topics and avoid bringing up their age.<br><br><strong>Rageful Diatribes</strong><br><br>Ranting and raving about a certain topic or person is never a good look. It can make your date feel like you're not in control of your emotions and it can also make them feel uncomfortable. So, try to keep the conversation focused on other topics and avoid getting into any rageful diatribes.<br><br><strong>Judging Their Dating History</strong><br><br>Judging someone's dating history is a definite no-no. It can make your date feel like you're trying to put them down or make them feel self-conscious. So, try to keep the conversation focused on other topics and avoid bringing up their past relationships.<br><br>Going on a first date can be a nerve-wracking experience, but it doesn't have to be. By avoiding certain topics and conversations, you can make sure that your date goes smoothly and that you make a good impression. That's why we've rounded up seven things to avoid bringing up during your conversation to make sure it all goes smoothly. Too much talk about your ex, any weirdly personal questions, sex talk and only sex talk, love bombing, food shaming, comments about someone's age, rageful diatribes, and judging their dating history are all topics to avoid.
